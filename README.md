# sublime-files
An extracted backup of Sublime Text's files.

This was initially inspired by [sublime-default][] but that fell short of having the non-default included Sublime Packages. As a result, I decided to set up this repo.

[sublime-default]: https://github.com/randy3k/sublime-default

## Why?
When writing plugins and researching Sublime Text's API, it's very useful to have a hosted and sharable reference for code comments and forum posts.

## You are out of date
Whoops! Please either create an issue or a pull request about that. If you would like to run the script, it can be run via:

```bash
# Remove all Sublime files
./delete-sublime.sh

# Download the latest EULA
./download-eula.sh

# Download/extract latest Sublime tarball
./extract-sublime.sh <url>
# For example:
# ./extract-sublime.sh http://c758482.r82.cf2.rackcdn.com/sublime_text_3_build_3083_x64.tar.bz2
```

URLs should be the portable tarballs provided for Sublime Text 3 from:

http://www.sublimetext.com/3

## Is this legal?
I am not a lawyer but yes, it should be legal. Under Sublime Text's EULA, we can host "backups and archival [copies]" of Sublime Text.
